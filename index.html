  <h1>Sean's Profile</h1>
  <img src="img/me.jpg" alt="" width=200px; height=200px;>
  <h2>Personal Information:</h2>
  <p title= "Personal Information about me" style="color:black;">My name is Sean Carboon. My student number is: s3947968 and my student email is: s3947968@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Australia and am therefore an Australian citizen. I am half Filipino from my mother’s side. I have recently graduated from secondary school. I can speak two languages English and Tagalog (The main language of the Philippines). However, I have no formal education in Tagalog, since I was taught by my mum. So I can communicate fluently enough to communicate when travelling to the Philippines, when buying food, getting transportation, or talking with my cousins. But I do not know the intricacies of the language and I will sometimes use English along with Tagalog to verbalize my statements.</p>
  <h3>Interesting Fact:</h3>
  <p>An interesting fact about me is my music taste I love to listen to 70s, 80s and 90s rock and pop music and tend to dislike rap music. Some bands I like to listen to are Boston, The Beach Boys, America, and The Eagles just to name a few. Some of the artists I enjoy listening to are George Michael and Jeff Buckley.</p>
  <h2>Interest in IT:</h2>
  <p title= "My IT interest's" style="color:black;">I have had an interest in IT specifically in the programming aspect since 2017 when I was in year 8 undertaking this coding class elective. We were learning to code using code.org I had no idea how to code and it was simple. In fact, I found out in 2020 when I chose to undertake Software Development units 1 and 2 as a VCE subject that it was far more complex. I was learning to code in Visual Studio, Vb.Net. I found the learning curve steep, considering I had no idea how to code previously. My teacher made the class engaging and encouraged us to persevere and use online resources if we were stuck.</p>
  <h3>Event that sparked interest:</h3>
  <p>The event that sparked my interest in IT was during year 11 when we were assigned a group project and had to design an idea for a project. We had options to create prototypes in Vb.Net or a challenge was to complete an entire program that entirely works. The project could already exist and we were allowed to replicate it as long as we could explain how the code worked if asked. In my group, we decided to make space invaders. I decided to code the entire game myself since the lockdowns were coming into place at the time and we had to complete the project online. I knew that each of us attempting to code individual parts of the program would not be feasible since we had no idea how to code space invaders and the program may not work when combined. With the help of youtube tutorials and forums, I made one level of space invaders (with bugs). The satisfaction of making a working game and having additional time to try to fix bugs made me inclined to complete units 3 and 4 of Software Development in year 12. </p>
  <h3>Why I chose Rmit?</h3>
  <p>I chose to come to RMIT since I had heard from friends and family that RMIT provided more practical experience required to undertake jobs after completing the degree. Compared to their counterparts like Monash which I had heard taught more theoretical knowledge which would not be as useful to get a job and that specifically if I was to complete a Bachelors of Information Technology degree that RMIT has better resources. They were also the only university that provided an option to complete the Bachelors of Information Technology through Open University.  </p>
  <h3>What I expect to learn?</h3>
  <p>During the completion of my degree, I expect to learn essential knowledge and skills to get a career in the IT field. Specifically, I expect to learn many coding languages and knowledge relating to cyber security tactics to prevent intruders from gaining access to particular systems or servers. I expect to improve my skills in working in a team to complete projects which would be necessary if I worked for an organization on a project, or had to work with others in cyber security. Furthermore, I should be able to work more independently in solving problems relating to code.</p>
  <h2>Ideal Job: Junior - Mid Java Developer</h2>
  <a href= "https://www.seek.com.au/job/56267183?type=standout#sol=bc2fe8a9cb7e92cc15ebdd6810e2490e3c22b1dc">Ideal job link</a>

  <img src="img/Jobrequirements.png" alt="" width=700px; height=900px;>
  <h3>Position I chose:</h3>
  <p>The position would entail utilising java to develop programs that would then be integrated into websites or software whichever is necessary. I would assume the programs are made for the client who may have particular requirements for their business or company and as the developer, we are designated to work on the programming aspect of the technology. It appeals to me since it will be a challenging position and build my skills and experience. Along with the opportunity to work with like-minded individuals seems enjoyable.</p>
  <h3>Skills/qualifications/Experience required:</h3>
  <p>The experience required for the job is Java, spring boot which is a framework to develop programs in Java easier. Amazon web services, Angular which is another framework that provides a simpler way of building Java programs. The skills/ qualifications I’d require are at least two years of work in java development. A bachelor’s degree in computer science or an equivalent field. I’d assume a Bachelor’s of Information technology degree would suffice. A background in using the latest technologies. An agile experience and mindset mean to be versatile and able to acquire more skills and flexible in my thinking. The ability to communicate my ideas freely and concisely to effectively share my ideas with colleagues. </p>
  <h3>Skills/qualifications/Experience I have:</h3>
  <p>The skills and experience I currently have required for the position would be strong verbal communication skills. Since in my high school Software Development class, we made a game. I ended up leading the group and had to convey specifically what the other team members had to do relating to debugging for particular issues or changing the audio for particular sounds. I have an agile mindset and the ability to be versatile when required assuming I am competent enough for the position. </p>
  <h3>Plan to obtain the skills:</h3>
  <p>To acquire the other skills/qualifications and experience required such as Java, I will gain familiarity throughout the completion of my Bachelor’s of Information Technology degree. Then build on that experience post completion of the degree to achieve the two years of java development required. With the completion of my degree, I will acquire an equivalent to a computer science degree. To receive the experience using spring boot I can the core spring training and spring boot developer training available on their website. I will gain experience with the latest technologies and a strong understanding of TDD throughout the progress of my degree. I can get an AWS certification to prove my experience through the amazon website. Through the Angular online courses, I can acquire the experience and certifications required to satisfy the requirements.</p>
  <h2>Personal Profile:</h2>
  <h3>Myers Briggs Personality test results: INTJ</h3>
  <img src="img/intj.png" alt="" width=250px; height=300px;>
  <h3>Strengths:</h3>
  <p>Rational, informed, independant, determined, curious, versatile,</p>
  <h3>Weaknesses:</h3>
  <p>Arrogant, dismissive of emotions, overly critical, combative, romantically clueless</p>
  <h3>Learning Styles Results:</h3>
  <p>Auditory: 35%, Visual: 25% and Tactile: 40%</p>
  <h3>Methods to improve learning:</h3>
  <p>Participate in activities that involve touching, building, moving, or drawing. Do lots of hands-on activities like completing art projects, taking walks, or acting out stories. It's OK to chew gum, walk around, or rock in a chair while reading or studying.
    Use flashcards and arrange them in groups to show relationships between ideas.
    Trace words with your finger to learn to spell (fingerspelling).
    Take frequent breaks during reading or studying periods (frequent, but not long).
    It's OK to tap a pencil, shake your foot, or hold on to something while learning.
    Use a computer to reinforce learning through the sense of touch.
  </p>
  <h3>Big Five Personality Test Results:</h3>
  <img src="img/big5results.png" alt="" width=400x; height=250; >
  <p>O = Openess, C = Conscientiousness, E = Extraversion, A = Agreeableness, N = Neuroticism </p>
  <h3>What the results mean to to me?</h3>
  <p>I think that the Myers Briggs Personality Test indicates that I work better alone and tend to stay by myself and do not rely on others in most situations. From the second statistic fifty-two per cent intuitive, I would think it highlights I make the majority of my decisions off instinct. The other results would indicate I make decision-based on thoughts and rationality, I also make plans in advance and try to align my plans with goals and finally when I make a decision I am confident of my choice and that I am correct. The learning styles test would indicate that I learn best by doing practical activities, and I should continue to learn this way to be more efficient in learning. The last test would show that I like thinking about abstract ideas and am willing to consider various ideas and opinions. Also that I am hardworking and disciplined to get what I desire, I tend to like being alone. I am combative in discussions and I will speak my mind and tend not to be as susceptible to experiencing negative emotions.</p>
  <h3>How the results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>
  <p>When behaving in a team I think I will be inclined to be quiet but also say my opinions when I think an incorrect decision is made. In relation to working together, I may tend to attempt to do most of the work by myself so I get an outcome that matches my desired outcome. Consequently, I may disregard others or be overly critical of every potential negative outcome of their idea to get my way. From the results, I think I may come across as too overbearing or expect too much from others to meet my standard and dismiss the reality that they may be different standards for themselves, time constraints and work ethic. </p>
  <h3>Considerations when forming a team</h3>
  <p>When forming a team I should consider being more charitable towards their ideas be less controlling. I should also be accommodating of others' desire to work together online while chatting or in call as we work. Whereas, usually, I would prefer each of us to be designated tasks to complete then collating our work at the end. Furthermore, I should be more flexible concerning times to meet online as others will have different schedules. In addition, I should be more open to considering team members' feelings and potential desire to do spontaneous bursts of work instead of adhering to a rigid schedule. </p>
  <h2>Project Idea:</h2>
  <h3>Overview:</h3>
  <p>The project I have thought of is a modification of the existing doorbell but with an addition of a light and an led screen which can provide a message indicating that someone has rung the doorbell. This would work the same way as the normal doorbell however having the added features of an led screen and a light that could flash or be solid depending on how often the doorbell was rung within a given period. This has the benefit of being seen by the person in the house without necessarily having to be heard if the person is wearing headphones or in another room.</p>
  <h3>Motivation:</h3>
  <p>Although the popularity of doorbells in the younger generations has decreased. There is more utility to a visual representation or message indicating someone is at the door. This product has the benefit of aiding those with hearing loss. 1 in 6 Australians suffers from hearing loss which means 4.1 million Australians in the country have some level of hearing loss. As younger people are more frequently listening to music at higher levels the percentage of people with hearing loss is expected to be 1 in 4 by 2050. Therefore when people cannot hear their doorbell ring having a visual representation is very necessary. </p>
  <h3>Description:</h3>
  <p>The features of this project will be the doorbell wiring to a speaker/led lights and mini led screens, which will emit a loud sound when the doorbell is rung. Another feature is a mini light like led beads which will emit light when the doorbell is rung. This could be added to each room in the house to alert the owner wherever they are in the house. A flashing function could be added when the doorbell is pressed multiple times within a given period. There will also be a mini led screen that could to placed on the wall alongside the led lights in each room. The message on the led screen could vary along with the led light flashing indicating the doorbell ringer is pressing it multiple times within a given period.
An example: you are studying in your bedroom at night and the doorbell rings. You are wearing headphones and do not hear them. However, since there is an led light and led screen you see someone has rung the doorbell. Depending on the time you may not want to answer the doorbell. However, the led light could start flashing repeatedly indicating the person is pressing the doorbell frequently and the message on the led screen could state something along the lines of “The doorbell ringer is frantic” or “They could be dangerous” or “An emergency could be occurring”.
A microcontroller such as an: Adruino or Raspberry pi would have to be used to control the input and outputs of the doorbell being rung. If a Raspberry pi was used then the programming could be completed through the python language and utilise idle and the editor. If the Arduino were used then the Arduino IDE program would have to be installed to program the Arduino. The program could be made available for the admin ( the owner of the doorbell) to control the flashing frequency of the led light and the message that appears on the led screen.
Another byproduct of using my specific doorbell would be an ability to disable the audio sound, meaning the speaker. This could be immensely useful to people who have young children or babies. Since babies are notoriously hard to get to sleep the annoyance of someone ringing the doorbell could be very bothersome to the parents. With the led screen and light the parents could still be alerted of the person ringing the doorbell without having to wake up the baby could be very useful for couples with children.
Another feature along with the ability to disable audio would be the freedom to set up the led light and led screens wherever necessary. For example: in the bedroom, you may not want an led light to flash at night when you are sleeping as it may interrupt your sleep patterns. Instead, a dimmer led screen that won’t necessarily wake you up or interrupt your sleep. Whereas in your study room you may want a bright led screen since you listen to music while studying and will not hear the person right the doorbell.
</p>
<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>The software to program I would use is the Arduino IDE program as I have coded in the program used an Adruino board previously. I would need wiring for the light lights, led screens and speaker to be connected to the Arduino through the walls as to not interfere with everyday movement throughout the house. The led bead lights could be used as a mini alert system in the particular room along with a mini led screen that could be attached to the wall. Other requirements, a drill for the holes in the wall for wiring along with a soldering iron to solder components together. </p>
<h3>Skills required:</h3>
<p>Programming knowledge in Arduino IDE language
Soldering wires capabilities to assure good connections are made between the wires and the components.
Ability to correctly connect components to the pins of the Arduino board.
The programming aspect I already think I have the skills necessary to complete. I can solder decently however I don’t own a soldering iron so I would have to purchase one. I have the skills to connect the components to the Arduino board. However, I would not try to wire this in the walls since potential bad wiring could start a wire and probably is not even legal. Then a qualified electrician would have to be employed to install the system properly. </p>
<h3>Ideal outcome:</h3>
<p>If the project were to be successful then I would have a working doorbell system along with the led screen and led light to light up according to the user’s request in the program. The problem solved would be the person not hearing the doorbell being rung and having an alternative where they can see it being rung. The impact of this would be people who have children or earring impairment can now utilise the additional functions that my doorbell provides.</p>
